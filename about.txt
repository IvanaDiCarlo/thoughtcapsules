# About this website 

I was pretty miserable, and I was wasting a bit of time looking for examples of "brutalist" web design.
I found a site called Simple Living, https://simpleliving.neocities.org/, and my therapist's words came up again. Journaling would be useful for you.
So I thought this minimal approach was exactly what I needed to start a new kind of journaling habit. 
So, in the words of that inspirational website, this one is about the things I consider basic and essential to life, presented in simple text files, in the form of a (i hope so) daily journal.

My interests: 
 * health 
 * minimalism  
 * budgeting 
 * lego
* photography
