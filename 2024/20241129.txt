# Routines

I might be a bit nerdy about routines, but they’re a lifesaver for me right now.

Take my workday start, for example—it’s a whole ritual:
* Place 3 × 0.5L water bottles on my desk.
* Keep my snacks within reach.
* Make oat milk coffee.
* Clean my glasses (this feels like the official “start” button for my brain).

Following the most accepted rules about habit making, routines halp me build some sort of stacks, swo many daily activitied became a routine.
Every meal, every task at work that can be turned into a process.
One routine > one txt note.
