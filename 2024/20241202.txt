# Self-reflection

How much self-reflection is worth it, useful, and when it becomes too much?
When do you move from "I'm trying to improve" to "I'm just venting all the time"? 

I think it all comes down to how balanced self-reflection is to actions. 
Keep in mind that self-reflecting must lead to action.
