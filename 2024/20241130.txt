# Busyness

Constant busyness is unhealthy. It means you’re unable to organize your tasks and, more importantly, you can’t be alone with your thoughts. I’m not downplaying how difficult this is, but I now believe it’s one of the most essential skills to develop.

I’m committing to 3 minutes of meditation each day. It might sound trivial, but it’s something many people recommend. Start small. Even 3 minutes can feel long if your mind never stops wandering. Three minutes may lead your restless mind to darker places, but with practice, it can also bring peace and relaxation.
