# Sickness

I really dislike feeling physically sick. It often feels like I can’t do anything except stay with the illness, and, of course, it’s frustrating. I wish I could just stay in bed all day when I feel like this, but it’s difficult to get my family to understand that I need time to rest, especially since they probably see me as someone who never does. How much of that is on me? Did I make them believe I never need a break?
