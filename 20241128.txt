# today is just the beginning

Committing to write every day is a bit of a challenge.

As I reflect on what this space is, here’s what I’m thinking:
* It’s not a journal in the traditional sense—not a place for whining or personal rants.
* It’s more about reflecting on my experiences, doing brain dumps, and exploring thoughts related to personal growth, minimalism, and my other interests.

Today, I’ve been thinking about the fine line between venting and productively expressing feelings. I believe it’s a delicate balance. I try to avoid both whining (actively or passively) as much as possible.
